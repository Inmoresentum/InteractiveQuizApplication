## System Requirements

To test and run the application, or if you want to modify
things according to your needs

you will have to install the following things.

1. java

   `jdk` version **17**
   Download [jdk](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
   if you don't have it already.

   If you're on unix like system, you can use [SDK MAN](https://sdkman.io/)
   which has certain advantages over other methods.

   To check your version of java, run:

   ```shell
    java --version
   ```
   or
   ```shell
   javac --version
   ```

2. node

   `node` version **21** or higher. Download [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have it already.

   To check your version of node, run:

   ```shell
   node --version
   ```

3. npm

   `npm` version **10.2.3** or higher. You will have it after you install node.

   To check your version of `npm`, run:

   ```shell
   npm --version
   ```

## Setup

To set up, please follow these steps:

<details>
<summary>Back-End</summary>

1. Clone the repo if you haven't already

   make sure that you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
   To check run `git --version` in your
   terminal.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Inmoresentum/InteractiveQuizApplication.git
   ```

2. Change directory to the project directory

    ```shell
    cd  InteractiveQuizApplication
    ```
   or open this directory with your favourite `code editor` or `IDE`
   which will download all the dependencies for [maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/).
   We used [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) but other code
   `editors` or `IDES` will also do the job.

3. Wait for Maven to download all the dependencies.

4. Now You have to Set up MariaDB and to do that you can either [download MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) for your
   operating system or use [docker to spin up a MariaDB container](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb).
   By default, the backend server is expecting MariaDB to run on `port: 3306`, so you will have
   make sure that your instance of mariadb is also running on that port.
   However, if you want to overrider the default configuration, then you can do in two ways.
    1. Taking advantage of the environment that is used in the
       [application.properties](/src/main/resources/application.properties) file
    2. Or Changing the provided default `spring.datasource.url`

   Furthermore, you have to create a database called `quiz_application_database` else you can
   override the configuration mentioned in the previous steps.

5. For email sending and testing purpose while developing the application, we used
   [MailDev](https://maildev.github.io/maildev/) which you can easily set up through docker
   using their [latest image](https://hub.docker.com/r/maildev/maildev).
   If you are planning on overriding or changing the default configuration
   and then please consult with
   [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties) file.

6. For storing images, videos and other objects, you will need to have [minio](https://min.io/)
   which is a S3 compatible object storage solution.
   You can easily spin up a [minio container](https://min.io/docs/minio/container/index.html) using docker,
   or you can manually download docker for your respective platform from [here](https://min.io/download#/linux).
   Furthermore, you have to make sure that you create the necessary user account(s) with permissions.
   Important thing to note that spring boot is expecting a bucket called **quiz_storage** already be there
   when the server starts.
   So make sure to create it if it does not already exist.
    * Note: It's also possible to use [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) as well with `minioClinet` but for that
      you will have to do some extra configuration by yourself.

7. For scanning files and binaries for viruses and harmful contents, you will need
   <a name="clamAVREf">[clamav-rest](https://github.com/ajilach/clamav-rest) </a> which is a rest service
   built on top of [ClamAV](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav).

   **Note**: The backend is expecting the [clamav-rest](#clamAVREf) service to run on port `7075` **(http)**
   and `9443` **(https)**.

8. And then finally Click the `play` icon which will start the spring boot application
   Alternatively, from the terminal use the included `maven` wrapper to build and
   run using
    ```shell
    ./mvnw clean install
    ``` 
8. By default, the backed server should start at **http://localhost:8080**

9. To check the OpenAPI documentation for created APIs,
   please visit **https://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html** ðŸ˜€

<details>
<summary>Front-End</summary>

1. Clone the repo if you haven't already

   make sure that you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
   To check run `git --version` in your
   terminal.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Inmoresentum/InteractiveQuizApplication.git
   ```

2. Change directory to the project directory

    ```shell
    cd  /FrontEnd/interactive-quiz-app   
    ```
   Now you have to download all the frontend dependencies using `npm`.
   To do so run the following command
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```
   This will download all `npm` dependencies.

3. Now run the local development server by using
   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```
   By default, the Front-End server should start at **http://localhost:3000**
