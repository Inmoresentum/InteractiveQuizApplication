## System Requirements

To test and run the application, or if you want to modify
things according to your needs

you will have to install the following things.

1. java

   `jdk` version **17**
   Download [jdk](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
   if you don't have it already.

   If you're on unix like system, you can use [SDK MAN](https://sdkman.io/)
   which has certain advantages over other methods.

   To check your version of java, run:

   ```shell
    java --version
   ```
   or
   ```shell
   javac --version
   ```

2. node

   `node` version **18** or higher. Download [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have it already.

   To check your version of node, run:

   ```shell
    node --version
   ```

3. npm

   `npm` version **8.5** or higher. You will have it after you install node.

   To check your version of npm, run:

   ```shell
    npm --version
   ```

## Setup

to set up, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo

   make sure that you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.
   To check run `git --version` in your
   terminal.
   ```shell
    // to be aded
   ```

2. Change directory to the project directory

    ```shell
    cd To Be Added
    ```
   or open this directory with your favourite `code editor` or `IDE`
   which will download all the dependencies for maven.
   We used [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) but other code
   `editors` or `IDES` will also do the job.

3. Click the `play` icon which will start the spring boot application
   and will recursively download all the `npm` dependencies.
   Alternatively, from the terminal use maven to build and
   run using `./mvnw clean install`.

4. By default, the server should start  **http://localhost:8080**
